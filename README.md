# TMI (Tell Me Info)

TMI is a *blazingly fast* simple but useful CLI for automating system monitors across a variety of applications. With a single command, TMI can be used to spin up a constantly updating monitor for RAM, CPU, disk space, or more. This is especially useful in ricing in conjunction with applications like [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) or [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar).
